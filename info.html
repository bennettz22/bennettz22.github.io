<p class="lw"> <font color="maroon">I'm 14, and I attend Saint Peters Prep. I've lived in JC, NJ my whole life so Spp was perfect for me. I went to the HAP program at Spp going into eight grade and, I went to St.Joseph in middle school. I got conditionally accepted to Prep about half way through the school year. I had to raise my grades if i wanted to go to Prep. I worked hard and visited the school, until early June i got the official acceptance letter.</font></p>
